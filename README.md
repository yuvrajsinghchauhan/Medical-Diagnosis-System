# Medical-Diagnosis-System
Medical diagnosis is basically a pattern classification phenomena: based on some input 
provided by a patient, an expert gives a conclusion on the basis of its knowledge, which is 
normally stored in a binary form, and finally the result is calculated i.e. either the patient 
suffering from a certain disease or not.
